        <p>
            I will attempt to implement algorithms designed to simulate fluid movement in an environment. I plan to use
            the Unity Engine to provide a visual for the fluid, but all simulation will be implemented. Because incredibly
            accurate fluid simulation algorithms are incredibly slow, I will be focusing on ones that are more for real-time
            viewing. I am working alone on this project.
        </p>

        <h2 align="padded">Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            Because fluid simulation is complex, extremely accurate algorithms take far too long for viewers to experience in
            real time. This means that fluid simulation with these algorithms is useful for movies or scientific research, but useless 
            for any interactive uses. Algorithms such as position based fluids trade perfect accuracy for speed, and as such can be
            run in real-time. This means that rendering times for movies or games that use fluid simulation can be reduced.
        </p>

        <h2 align="padded">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
        <p>
            Position based fluid simulation is able to run in real-time, so it would be possible to modify the environment in
            real time to show this is happening. I plan to implement a real time fluid simulation algorithm, and will present it
            by placing a modification in the environment and running the engine to show how the fluid reacts. This will show that
            realistic looking fluids can be simulated in real-time. If ahead of schedule, I would really like to allow for an
            interactive system where the viewer can modify the environment and possibly add fluid. This would be a great way for
            users to see how different environments affect fluid movement.
        </p>

        <h2 align="padded">Schedule</h2>
        <p>
            For the first week, I plan to implement at least one algorithm for real-time fluid simulation. This will most likely
            be position based. For the second week, I plan to work on another algorithm if the first is not satisfactory. In addition
            I will also find a way to manipulate the environment so that viewers can see how the simulation is in real-time. If I am
            satisfied with my algorithm after the first week, I will most likely be able to design some level of interactivity for users
            during the second week.
        </p>

        <h2 align="padded">Resources</h2>
        <p>
            I am attempting to implement algorithms that have been created and documented in research papers by two universities as well as a paper from Nvidia.
            The following links are to each of these research papers/articles.
